## Dog Breed Recognition (DBR) Using Deep Learning Models
This project implements and evaluates three deep learning architectures for dog breed recognition on the RAF-DB dataset:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
EfficientNetB0
Vit_B16
The goal is to compare model performance in terms of classification accuracy, inference speed, and model size and to deploy the best-performing models in a browser-based real-time website recognition demo.
